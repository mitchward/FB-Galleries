Personal project to develop my jQuery skills, which will be constantly built upon until I am bored with it. Hopefully I can end up with something to use in my future projects.

Uses [fancyapp's fancyBox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox) for the gallery lightbox, the rest is written by myself.

A demo can be seen [here](http://mitchward.co.uk/plugins/slider/).
